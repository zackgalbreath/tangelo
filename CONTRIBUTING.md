How to Contribute
=================

We love hearing from Tangelo users, whether by email, on the issue tracker, or
via pull request.  Here are some guidelines for contributing:

- Please email us at <tangelo-users@public.kitware.com> if you have any questions or concerns or if you need help with any usage problems you encounter while using Tangelo.
- If you have feature requests or bug reports, go ahead and open a new issue on the [tracker](https://github.com/Kitware/tangelo/issues).
- If you would like to contribute actual code, follow these steps:

1. Get a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
2. [Fork](https://github.com/Kitware/tangelo/fork) the Tangelo repository.
3. Create a topic branch for your changes.
4. Make commits as needed, and include informative commit messages.  Try to structure your commits logically, so that each one has a clear-cut purpose.
5. Send us a pull request according to the guidelines [here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

The Tangelo documentation includes a section on [coding guidelines](http://tangelo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/coding-style-guide.html) to help ease your contributions into the codebase.  Refer to the rest of the [documentation](http://tangelo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) as needed, and let us know if anything is unclear.  We're looking forward to hearing from you!
